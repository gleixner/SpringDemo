When making a new database, create files with "initdb -D ./" in the directory of choice.
create a new database with the command createdb -U postgres mydb

Port that server is available on can be changed in the file C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.4\data\postgresql.conf line 63
In the same file, change listen_address from 'localhost' to '127.0.0.1'

start postgres server with "pg_ctl start -l logfile -D ./"
stop the server with "pg_ctl stop -D ./"


-U means the string that follows it is the username.  "postgres" is the default username using the password that you setup when you install postgress.
"mydb" is the name of the database

you can access the new database with the command psql -U postgres mydb

The url of a database is https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/80/connect.html.  So in my case it woould be jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb
